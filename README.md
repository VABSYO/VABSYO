# Introdution
Hi!
My name is VABSYO.
I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering.

My hobbies include - binge watching(both series and animes, not a fan of movies tho), reading books, cycling, and learning to play Carnatic Violin

My skills include - Curious and eager to learn, time-management, determined and focused, professional ethics, good verbal and written English skills, and possess good leadership skills

Being completely new to this world of Open-Source Software, I don't even know much about GitHub except the fact that I have heard about it a lot.
But, I am eager to learn and contribute to it as much as possible.
And, hopefully, will be able  to find things that tickle my curious side and hone myself further by gaining experience

Thanks for reading this, and hope you were able to understand me better!
And if we are collaborating, here's a cheer for a successful journey ahead! :)
